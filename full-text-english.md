Of all natural phenomena, which has not only been more persistently admired and widespread, but also dreaded, than the sporadically occuring meteors: storms accompanied by thunder and flashes, and the most silent and mysterious drifting comets and luminous spheres? Of all unusual phenomena, striking each and every one of us, which has remained inexplicable until this time other than these comets and meteorites, the rare cases of the latter appraching the Earth as balls of fire, tumbling down with thunderous patter? These stones are then discovered as angular fragments, slightly smooth and covered with a thin dark crust; this crust appears to be produced by the melting of the inner, unaltered mass, brought about by the heating undergone by the stone from friction against the atmosphere, through which it pierces at high speed. The friction during their passage through the atmosphere makes the stones glowing and luminous. In their various sizes they fall to the Earth, from many cubic feet of material weighing over 1000 talents, to bean size and sometimes even observed in the form of sand.

Some time ago I reported in these pages about small glowing stones recently fallen on people or in their immediate vicinity which belonged to the stone class of meteorites: here near Schaffhausen a man was shot in an open field through the arm, under circumstances which pointed only to a meteorite projectile. The case observed in France last year, when a farmer saw a stone fall beside him in a field and sold it to a museum only to become involved in a lawsuit, can still be remembered. These items are relatively insignificant, although certainly interesting knowledge. Many other infinitely greater ones are enumerated in the annals of natural history. A rain of stones fell near Shahabad in Hindostan in 1810, killing people and inflaming buildings. On the night of September 4, 1511 hundreds of stones fell in northern Italy; heavy pieces were brought to Milan by peasants; a monk lost his life due to this rain of stones and animals were killed in great numbers. Even the annals of the Chinese have reported, for centuries before our era, many cases of luminous meteors that fell to Earth. In 616 BC, according to them, a fireball appeared in the sky from which stones fell to Earth after an explosion, killing ten people and smashing a wagon. Similarly, Greek and Roman writers mention the stone rain. Even the christian Middle Ages, which was only concerned with the creator and his family, not with the Creation, did not leave these strange manifestations of heaven completely ignored. Numerous observations of meteorites descending to Earth were recorded in modern times; Kesselmeyer, in his treatise on the origin of meteorite cases given to the Senkenberg Society in 1860, lists 647 meteoritic iron and stone falls with greater or lesser reliabililty. Many stones whose falls were observed in the glowing state have been collected, examined, and preserved; rocks which were sometimes identified as metals, sometimes mixtures of metals or even coal and other organic elements.

However, the actual nature and history of development of these bodies, their origin, and their relationship to the Earth and other bodies of the universe, has remained shrouded in a seemingly impenetrable darkness.

The French physicist [Jean-André] Deluc made the first attempt to find an explanation for the fact of the falling "fireballs" of Earth "sent by the Gods, [?] Drakel giving forth Batylien", aërolites, meteorological, or aerial stones. He tried to prove that they were ejections from the volcanoes of Earth because, as a matter of fact, some of the compositions of many meteorites coincides with that of many volcanic rocks and outflows, or at least very similar to them. This attempt failed because of the lack of enough ejecting power in our volcanoes, which was soon proven by calculation, and as there are such enormous meteorite masses found on the Earth's surface. In the state of Oregon, North America, below 40° 35' at the Pacific Ocean, there is an iron meteorite block whose part projecting above ground was estimated by [John] Evans, who took a piece of it, at 10,000 kilos. The most famous block of meteoritic iron was brought by [Peter Simon] Pallas traveling from Siberia — famous because it prompted [Ernst] Chladni to pronounce the current theory of the nature of meteorites — weighing 688 kilos —[Karl Ludwig von] Reichenbach estimates the annual weight of falling rock masses to 4,500 Zentner.

The idea expressed by [Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias] Olbers in 1795, that these meteorolites are not ejecta of Earth's volcanoes, but those of the Moon, an idea which [Pierre-Simon] Laplace considered acceptable, and was confirmed by many mathematicians by calculation, since the possibility was not contradictory: nevertheless, it gave way in considering that all the necessary and favorable combinations in the positions of the Earth and Moon so that a single meteorite with incoming speed of about 2,300 meters per second would reach the Earth far too rarely to explain the numerous meteorites.

Likewise, the opinion expressed by other researchers that meteorites are products of the atmosphere or congregations of atmospheric origin derived from the Earth's surface, could not be reconciled with the great distances, up to forty miles calculated for some flares, from which the meteorites fall to the Earth, and with the extraordinary thinning of the atmosphere at only an altitude of ten miles, where solid bodies could not stay in place to accumulate up to masses as heavy as those which fall down to the Earth.

It remained as the acceptable hypothesis of those remaining when in 1819 Chladni denied these luminous meteors and glowing meteor stones falling to Earth a meteorological nature and declared them to be cosmic bodies, like the stars, likely fragments of a shattered larger planet or independent planetary bodies whose orbits approach the Earth's orbit and in their relative smallness followed the attraction of the Earth itself. This idea probably lead to the discoveries, in that period from 1801 to 1807, of the four small planets orbiting in the middle point between Mars and Jupiter, by [Giuseppe] Piazzi, Olbers, and [Karl Ludwig] Harding, also maintaining that these were the shattered remains of a larger planet.
